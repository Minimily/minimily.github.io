# Minimily Website

This website uses [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) as static site generator.

## Installing Zola

Since we already use [Cargo]() to develop our products, we will also use it to install Zola from source.


```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/getzola/zola
zola --version
```

From the root of the repo, run:

```
zola serve
```
